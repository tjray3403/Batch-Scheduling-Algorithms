# Batch-Scheduling-Algorithms
Implemented three different batch scheduling algorithms and aim to compare the three to see which is the best, middle, and worse algorithm.
For our project we have implemented three different batch scheduling algorithms and aim to compare the three to see which is the best, middle, and worse algorithm.
The three different algorithms used are FIFO, SJF, and SRT.
The way we structured our code was by using the main cpp file to get our n which is the number of processes, calculate our arrival time, calculate our average CPU time, 
get our standard deviation percentage which is random from 0 - 100, and calculate our total cpu time which is also the remaining cpu time. 
The output of our code reveals the most efficient batch scheduling algorithm in our project.
